test cases for imageColoursDriver
since this function could not be implemented the same way in the main program, this was instead used to check if the code I had in mind would produce the results that I wanted.
Test 1:
    colourRow = [1, 0.5, 1, 0, 1]
    Expected Output:
    [White Grey White Black White]
    Actual Output:
    [White Grey White Black White]

Test 2:
    colourRow = [1, 0.5, 1, 0]
    Expected Output:
    Error
    Actual Output:
    Error

Test 3:
colourRow = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Expected Output:
[Black Black Black Black Black]
Actual Output:
[Black Black Black Black Black]
